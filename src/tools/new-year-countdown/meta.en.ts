  intro:
    'A live countdown to midnight on January 1, 2027 in your own time zone. It checks your clock against an accurate time server, switches to one huge number for the last minute, and fills your TV in full screen mode.',
  howTo: [
    'Open the page and the countdown starts right away, showing the days, hours, minutes and seconds left until midnight where you are.',
    'To put it on a TV or projector, press “Full screen”. Press Esc to leave full screen.',
    'Tick “Beep for the last 10 seconds” and tap anywhere on the page once so your browser allows sound.',
    'After midnight the page shows a Happy New Year screen for all of January 1, then starts counting to the next New Year on its own.',
    'Below the timer you will also find countdowns to New Year’s Eve and to Lunar New Year.',

        'The countdown always runs to midnight in the time zone your device is set to, so it works wherever you are: New York, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Honolulu, London or Sydney. The line under the timer shows which zone it is using.',
        'Want to ring in the New Year with friends or family elsewhere? Change the time zone in your device settings and reload, or use our time zone converter to see when midnight arrives in their city. For example, midnight in New York is 9:00 p.m. on December 31 in Los Angeles and 5:00 a.m. on January 1 in London.',

        'Most countdown pages simply read your phone or computer clock. If that clock is a few seconds off, your “3, 2, 1” will not match the fireworks. When this page opens it measures the difference between your device and an accurate server clock and corrects the countdown, so zero lands on the real midnight.',
        'Live TV and streams usually run a few seconds to more than ten seconds behind real time. If you are watching the Times Square ball drop on a stream, the ball may reach the bottom a little after this page hits zero.',

In 2027 it falls on Saturday, February 6, starting the Year of the Goat. The card under the timer counts down to it in your time zone.',
