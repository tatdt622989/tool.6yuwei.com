Likewise, a birthday of January 25, 1990 falls before Lunar New Year on January 27, so it is an Earth Snake, not a Metal Horse.',

A quick way to remember it is the last digit of the lunar year: 0 and 1 are Metal, 2 and 3 Water, 4 and 5 Wood, 6 and 7 Fire, and 8 and 9 Earth. Twelve animals times five elements gives the full 60-year cycle, so the same combination, such as the Fire Horse, comes back only every 60 years.',
