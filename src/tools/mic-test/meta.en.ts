        'Levels are shown in dBFS, decibels relative to full scale, where 0 dB is the loudest a digital signal can be. Normal speech at arm’s length usually sits around −30 to −15 dBFS. Below −55 dBFS the tester treats the mic as silent; above −6 dBFS or touching 0 dB, your voice is likely to clip and sound distorted.',
        'For calls, aim for the “Your microphone is working” range with peaks well below 0 dB. For podcasts and voiceovers, many people target peaks around −12 to −6 dBFS and leave the rest of the headroom for loud moments.',

That is why your voice may sound slightly different from a raw recording.',

This is normal. If the mic doesn’t appear at all, make sure the headset is connected as an audio input, not just as speakers.',

    {
      q: 'How do I know if my mic is working?',
      a: 'Press “Test my microphone”, allow access and speak. If the level meter moves and the verdict says your microphone is working, it is picking up sound. Record a 5-second clip and play it back to check the quality too.',

      q: 'Why does it say microphone access was blocked?',
      a: 'You or your system denied permission. Follow the steps shown under the error for your browser, then reload the page. On Windows 11 and macOS, the operating system’s privacy settings can also block the browser even when the site is allowed.',

      q: 'The meter moves, but people can’t hear me on Zoom or Teams.',
      a: 'Your microphone works, so the problem is in the app. Open the app’s audio settings and choose the same microphone you selected here, and make sure you aren’t muted in the meeting.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Why does my recording sound quiet or muffled?',
      a: 'Move closer to the mic, raise the input volume in your system sound settings, and avoid covering the mic. Bluetooth headsets use a low-bandwidth call profile, so a wired or USB mic will always sound clearer.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I test my mic on an iPhone or Android phone?',
      a: 'Yes. Open this page in Safari or Chrome and allow microphone access when asked. In-app browsers inside Instagram, Facebook or TikTok often can’t use the microphone, so open the page in your regular browser.',

    {
      q: 'Is my voice recorded or uploaded?',
      a: 'No. Audio is analyzed and recorded only in your browser and is never uploaded. The 5-second clip stays on your device unless you download it, and the microphone stops when you leave the page.',
