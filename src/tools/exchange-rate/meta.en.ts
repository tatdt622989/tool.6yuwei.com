      body: [
        'An exchange rate tells you how much of one currency you get for one unit of another. If 1 USD = 0.90 EUR, then $500 converts to 500 × 0.90 = €450. Going the other way you divide: €100 is 100 ÷ 0.90 ≈ $111.11.',
        'Rates between two non-dollar currencies, such as euros to yen, are cross rates. This converter derives every pair from one daily set of rates, so EUR to JPY is consistent with USD to EUR and USD to JPY. For currencies with small units, like the yen, won or dong, the quick table switches to amounts such as 1,000 and 10,000 so the numbers stay readable.',

      body: [
        'The mid-market rate is the midpoint between the buy and sell prices that banks trade at with each other. It is the fairest benchmark, and it is what this tool shows. Almost nobody exchanges money at exactly that rate, though.',
        'Banks, airport exchange kiosks, card networks and transfer services all add a spread on top, and some also charge a fixed fee. A bank might sell you euros a few percent above the mid-market rate, and airport kiosks are often much worse. To see what a quote really costs, convert the same amount here and compare: the gap is the markup you are paying.',

      heading: 'Tips for spending money abroad',
      body: [
        'Credit cards usually give a rate close to the mid-market rate, but many US cards add a foreign transaction fee of up to 3%. Cards marketed for travel often have no foreign transaction fee, which makes them one of the cheapest ways to pay overseas.',
        'When a card terminal or ATM abroad offers to charge you in US dollars, decline and pay in the local currency. This offer is called dynamic currency conversion, and the rate it uses is typically much worse than your card network’s. For cash, a debit card at a local bank ATM is usually cheaper than exchanging dollars before you leave, but check your bank’s ATM and foreign transaction fees first.',
