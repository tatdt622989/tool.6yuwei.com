        'Your age goes up by one year on each birthday. To get the months and days, the calculator counts whole calendar months from your last birthday and then the days left over. Someone born on June 15, 1990 is 36 years, 4 months and 14 days old on October 29, 2026.',
        'Counting months by the calendar, rather than as 30-day blocks, matches how people and most official forms think about age. A month is complete when the same day number comes around again, so January 31 to February 28 is 28 days rather than one month.',

For Social Security, full retirement age is 67 for anyone born in 1960 or later, and Medicare eligibility starts at 65.',

In common years, this calculator treats March 1 as the birthday, so someone born on February 29, 2004 turns 23 on Monday, March 1, 2027. Some states and organizations use February 28 instead; check the rule that applies if the exact day matters, such as for a driver’s license.',

    {
      q: 'How do I calculate my exact age?',
      a: 'Subtract your birth year from the current year, then subtract one if your birthday hasn’t happened yet this year. For months and days, count whole months since your last birthday and the days after that. The calculator does all of this for you.',
