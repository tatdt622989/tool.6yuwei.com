  howTo: [
    'Press “Test my webcam” and choose Allow when the browser asks to use your camera.',
    'Check the live preview. If you have more than one camera, choose it under “Camera”.',
    'Pick a “Requested resolution” (480p to 4K) and compare it with the “Actual resolution” and “Measured frame rate” below the preview.',

      body: [
        'Browsers ask the camera for a resolution, and the camera delivers the closest mode it supports. That is why “Actual resolution” can be lower than what you requested: many built-in laptop webcams top out at 720p (1280 × 720), while external webcams such as the Logitech C920 deliver 1080p (1920 × 1080). “Camera maximum” shows the largest size the driver reports.',
        'Most webcams run at 30 fps; some reach 60 fps at 720p. If the measured frame rate drops to 15 fps or lower, the room is usually too dark: the camera lengthens its exposure to gather light, which halves the frame rate. Add light in front of you, not behind you.',

      heading: 'Why is my webcam mirrored?',
      body: [
        'The preview is mirrored by default, like a bathroom mirror, because that feels natural when you look at yourself. The people on a Zoom, Teams or Google Meet call see the unmirrored image, so text on a shirt or sign reads correctly for them. Untick “Mirror preview” to see exactly what others see; snapshots are saved the way the preview is shown.',

On Windows 11, open Settings > Privacy & security > Camera and turn on both “Camera access” and “Let desktop apps access your camera”. On a Mac, open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera and turn on your browser.',
        'If the camera is “in use” or won’t start, close other apps that may hold it, such as Zoom, Teams, FaceTime or OBS. Many laptops also have a privacy shutter or a camera key (often F8 or F10) that disables the camera in hardware; a black image with no error usually means the shutter is closed.',

      q: 'How do I test my webcam?',
      a: 'Press “Test my webcam”, allow camera access and check the live preview. The resolution, aspect ratio and frame rate appear below it. If you see yourself, the webcam works.',

      q: 'Why does it say the camera is in use or couldn’t start?',

    {
      q: 'Why is the picture black?',
      a: 'A closed privacy shutter, a camera disable key, or another app holding the camera can all give a black image. Check the shutter on the bezel or webcam, and try the camera key on your laptop keyboard.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Why is my webcam quality worse than advertised?',
      a: 'The camera may not support the requested resolution, or it is lowering frame rate and detail in a dark room. Compare “Actual resolution” with “Camera maximum”, add light, and use a USB 3 port for 4K webcams.',

    {
      q: 'Can I test the camera on my iPhone or Android phone?',
      a: 'Yes. Open the page in Safari or Chrome and allow camera access. If your phone has several cameras, choose the front or rear camera in the “Camera” menu after the first start.',

      q: 'Is my video recorded or uploaded?',
      a: 'No. The video is shown only in your browser and is never recorded or sent anywhere. Snapshots stay on your device unless you download them.',
